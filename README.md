# Java Tutorials

**Note** *The assumption is that you have installed both the Java SDK and JRE*

## Question 1
>Write an application that calculates the product of the odd integers from 1 to n, where n is entered by the user.

To compile the code. Run the command below

```bash
javac oddNumbers.java
```

To run the code, type the command below.

```bash
java oddNumbers 5
```

For the command above, you'll get a response as shown below:

```bash
The product is: 15
```

## Question 2

>A parking garage charges a $2.00 minimum fee to park for up to three hours. The garage
charges an additional $0.50 per hour for each hour or part thereof in excess of three hours.
The maximum charge for any given 24-hour period is $10.00. Assume that no car parks for
longer than 24 hours at a time. Write an application that calculates and displays the parking
charges for each customer who parked in the garage yesterday. You should enter the hours
parked for each customer. The program should display the charge for the current customer
and should calculate and display the running total of yesterdayâ€™s receipts. The program
should use the method calculateCharges to determine the charge for each customer.


To compile the code. Run the command below

```bash
javac calculateCharges.java
```

To run the code, type the command below.

```bash
java calculateCharges 5
```

For the command above, you'll get a response as shown below:

```bash
Parking charge is: 3.0
```


## Happy coding :joy:
